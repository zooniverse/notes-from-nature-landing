      Florida State University's Robert K. Godfrey Herbarium documents the distribution
      and natural variation of 2,400 species of flowering plants, ferns, conifers, and
      cycads found in northern Florida. In this region a number of plant groups,
      including pitcherplants, reach their greatest species richness in North America.
